Churn Prediction Model Report
Introduction
The objective of this project is to develop a churn prediction model to identify customers who are likely to churn, allowing for targeted retention efforts. The selected model for this task is a Decision Tree classifier, chosen due to its performance in terms of accuracy during model selection.

Data Preprocessing
Data Collection
The dataset used for this project was obtained from [source] and contains information about customer demographics, subscription details, and usage behavior.
Data Cleaning
The initial dataset was assessed for missing values and duplicates. Missing data was handled through imputation, and duplicates were removed to ensure data quality.
Feature Engineering
To prepare the data for modeling, several feature engineering steps were performed:
Categorical variables such as "Gender" and "Location" were encoded using one-hot encoding to convert them into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms.
The "Age" feature was scaled to ensure that features with different scales did not impact the performance of the Decision Tree model.
Train-Test Split
The dataset was divided into a training set (used for model training) and a test set (used for model evaluation) with a typical split ratio (e.g., 70% training, 30% testing).
Model Selection
The Decision Tree classifier was selected as the model of choice for churn prediction based on the following considerations:
During the model selection phase, various classifiers, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Logistic Regression, were evaluated.
The Decision Tree classifier consistently demonstrated the highest accuracy on the validation data, making it the preferred choice for the task.
Additionally, Decision Trees offer interpretability, which can help in understanding the factors contributing to churn.
Model Training and Evaluation
The selected Decision Tree model was trained on the training dataset, and its performance was assessed using various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Cross-validation techniques were used to assess the model's generalization performance and mitigate overfitting.
Conclusion
In summary, this project aimed to build a churn prediction model using a Decision Tree classifier. The model was trained and evaluated on preprocessed data, achieving a high accuracy rate. The choice of the Decision Tree model was based on its consistent performance during model selection and its interpretability. Future work may involve refining the model further and incorporating additional features or algorithms to enhance predictive accuracy.
